## What is The Unsent Project?
* The Unsent Project is a collection of unsent messages to first loves.
* The [site](https://www.theunsentproject.com) was originally launched by [Rora Blue](https://www.rorablue.com/) in 2015 to analyze the relationship between colour and love. It has since amassed 1.8 million anonymously submitted messages.

## What makes this re-creation different?
This re-creation keeps the fundamental idea of the original project while adding a few twists:
* The Windows 95 Theme.
* A twitter-esque 140 character limit on messages.
* Displayed messages are not images but instead HTML elements.
* A PNG of the message can be downloaded by clicking the close icon on each message window.
